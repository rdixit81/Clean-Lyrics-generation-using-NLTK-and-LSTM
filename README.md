# Clean-Lyrics-generation-using-NLTK-and-LSTM

The first file senstence_classifier.py takes the input from any of the files that contain the original lyrics and tokenize the words to find out the probability of lines and then compare it with some predefined limit and if the probability is higher then that it is discarded as it is much negative sentence and then the positive lyrics are copied in filter.txt Then the second file will run i.e model.py that works in two ways that are test and train. in training the LSTM the lyrics from filter.txt are used to extract all the syllables and Markov if makes a list of all the similar words available in filter.txt, it works for five epochs. In the test phase, the code will generate new lyrics and save it into new text file i.e lyrics.txt Now third file speech.py use this lyrics.txt file to convert it into voice using Pyttsx (Python text to speech) library
